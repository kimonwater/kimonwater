Hello World!

🪐 I study Protestant & Islamic theology with a background in data science as in computer science

🐣 At the bottom of the AI hierachy of needs I can do development work myself, at the top I rather product manage but also wip

🖤 GitHub is a daunting place to be I mean it's the world's repo. I love to think of Jesus as master dev doing much with little so anyone relating, "fear not"!
