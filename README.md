Hello World!

🐣 I'm just a mini mini dev into data products

🌊 At the bottom of the AI hierarchy I can do development work myself, at the top I rather product manage but also wip  

🪐 I have a background in data science as in computer science (= not everyone needs that :D) and study protestant & islamic theology in addition

🖤 GitHub is kinda daunting I mean it's the world's repo. I love to think of Jesus as master dev so anyone relating, "fear not"!
