Hello World!

🐣 I'm just a mini mini dev at the bottom of the AI hierachy of needs, at the top I product manage but also wip  

🪐 I have a background in data science as in computer science (= not everyone needs that :D) and study protestant & islamic theology in addition

🖤 GitHub is kinda daunting I mean it's the world's repo. I love to think of Jesus as master dev working with little so anyone relating, "fear not"!
